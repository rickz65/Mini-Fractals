On Using the 'User Entered Equations' :

How to get the 'stupid' translator to properly digest more complicated algebraic statements ...

Exactly like this :

ZZ = sin[ZZ] / CC * floatG + ((pow[ZZ,(floatG+4)] + CC)*(1-floatG)) ;


Note:
pay carefule attention to the use of whitespace (space character) 
and before and after +-*/  and before and after (,) 

In some places use no spaces ...
In others places pad with both spaces ...



The Future OpenCL project:  Mini-Fractals-OpenCL 
will (i think) be able to have operator overrides and (Template?) Classes defined, 
which OpenGL can not.
Hence the Global Scope Functions, and the Annoying Translator.

I'll work on an improved translator, 
or alternate solution for the v2.0 of OpenGL Mini-Fractals.



Fun and interesting Tip:

Try the above example function in the 'User Entered Equation' text box, 
make sure it's just a single line in the box.
Set the 'floatG' value in it's text box to -1.0
Set the 'Animate floatG from above to:' value to 1.0 
and check the 'Animate' checkbox.
Finally, click on 'Make Fractal' Button.
Enjoy the Show.
Un-check the 'Animate' Checkbox to STOP the action.
