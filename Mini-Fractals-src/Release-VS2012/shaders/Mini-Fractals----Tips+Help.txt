Mini-Fractals is an OpenGL/MFC Appplication, that produces Orbital type Fractals, like the Mandelbrot Set.
It has two different Color Schemes, gradient color system and a e-Smoothing Coloring System.
The Calculations to produce the Fractal are done by your computers GPU, or Graphical Processing Unit, 
AKA a big Computer chip.

The Application can compile the User Entered code into GLSL language, using a complex number functions,
Such as ADD[x]  SUB[a,b] == a-b  ... ATANH[x] where x,a and b are complex numbers.

Getting The App to Up and Running Correctly with OpenGL :

Although using Windows Update, or a 3rd party Driver-Booster 
will have relatively new and functional drivers,
I have found that by installing The Whole, Large ATI Catalyst CCC,
About 70-120 MB in size, that Mini-Fractals will run (somewhat slow, about 10 FPS) on :
ATI 4250 Mobile, with 40 shaders. 
Before installing the whole CCC, the drivers where current to Nov. 2013, 
Although the App failed completely.

On Using the 'User Entered Equations' :

How to get the 'stupid' translator to properly digest more complicated algebraic statements ...

Exactly like this :

ZZ = sin[ZZ] / CC * floatG + ((pow[ZZ,(floatG+4)] + CC)*(1-floatG)) ;


Note:
pay carefule attention to the use of whitespace (space character) 
and before and after +-*/  and before and after (,) 

In some places use no spaces ...
In others places pad with both spaces ...



The Future OpenCL project:  Mini-Fractals-OpenCL 
will (i think) be able to have operator overrides and (Template?) Classes defined, 
which OpenGL can not.
Hence the Global Scope Functions, and the Annoying Translator.

I'll work on an improved translator, 
or alternate solution for the v2.0 of OpenGL Mini-Fractals.

Fun and interesting Tip:

ZZ = sin[ZZ] / CC * floatG + ((pow[ZZ,(floatG+4)] + CC)*(1-floatG)) ;

Try the above example function in the 'User Entered Equation' text box, 
make sure it's just a single line in the box.
Set the 'floatG' value in it's text box to -1.0
Set the 'Animate floatG from above to:' value to 1.0 
and check the 'Animate' checkbox.
Finally, click on 'Make Fractal' Button.
Enjoy the Show.
Un-check the 'Animate' Checkbox to STOP the action.

Note on Animate floatG values:
There is a bug in the code such that the first (top) value must be LESS that the Animate to value.
My appologies.
